# License notes
Homework code is licenced under AGPLv3 until the end of the Fall 2016 semester, at which time I will change the license to MIT.
This is to prevent plagarism by others from affecting me.
Basically: don't plagarise the algorithms, as doing so could put you at risk academically and legally.

You are welcome to use anything that isn't the core algorithms used to implement the assignments. This includes makefiles, shell scripts, notes, and the like.
