# Evolutionary Computation
Code and notes for Robert Heckendorn's excellent Evolutionary Computation course at the University of Idaho Fall 2016.

# A note on plagarism.

If you are currently in the class: DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN YOUR PROJECT. MIT License does not enable its use in a school assignment. Plagiarizing will get you suspended or expelled, I've seen it happen before. You're welcome to read it and fill gaps in understanding in C++, such as function calls and syntax, not the algorithms and logical structure of the program.
