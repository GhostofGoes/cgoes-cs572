Coming from the network and security domain I can say this for sure that the answers that I give here would not even scratch the surface of the different research trends happening in this field. I may even present a biased view on the subject, so do not take my answer to be the one and only. One of the professors who taught in the school I went to was researching on how to utilize browser based security flaws in order to collect more information about the end systems (hosts). You would find most ISP's and firewalls blocking scripts like Activex or Java or even maybe Flash, but not Javascript. Javascript is such a sandbox-safe language that you could practically decipher what application the user is running on his/her system, with you sitting over the internet. Although the browser is very much sandboxed and allows no applications to run without approval from the end user, there are ways to get over this requirement.
